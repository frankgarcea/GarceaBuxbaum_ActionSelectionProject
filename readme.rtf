Within the Supplemental Materials folder is an excel file with high and low conflict performance for each participant.
Also within this folder the JPG files needed to reproduce the test of grasp-use conflict.
R code to derive the high conflict (sometimes referred to as incongruent) residual scores for each task can be found in the ResidualAnalysis folder.
R code and CSV files in the ApraxiaXInterferenceAnalysis folder will reproduce the interaction analyses.
